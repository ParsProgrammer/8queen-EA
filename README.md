# 8 Queen problem -Genetic Algorithm
In this problem, the ultimate goal is about finding a way that queens can be placed on a chessboard so that none attack each other. it is clear that two each queen cannot be placed on the same either row or column then the only difficulty is to minimize diaognal threats. In order to solve this problem, we adopt Genetic Algorithm.

### Components of the algorithm
